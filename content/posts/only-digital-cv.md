In a digital world that moves fast, handing out printed CVs can feel a bit... dated. That’s why I’ve made a conscious decision to keep my CV only on my dedicated website.

Why?

Because a printed CV is static - it can’t reflect new projects, evolving responsibilities, or recent certifications. My online CV, on the other hand, is always current, easy to access, and better reflects my professional journey in real time.

Also, let’s be honest: sustainability matters. Every printed page counts.

Of course, if you really need a paper version (maybe you're stuck in a Wi-Fi-free zone), you can always download the latest PDF copy directly from my site. Just know the digital version is where the real story lives.
